Q: What about pricing?
A: It's flexible — depends on event size and what they need. The honest best way is a quick demo where the team tailors it. There's also a 30-day free trial so they can test everything before committing to anything.

Q: Is there a free trial?
A: 30 days, no risk. They can get it when they book a demo.

Q: How are we different from Eventbrite?
A: Eventbrite is great for ticketing. But that's mostly what it does. We're the whole package — ticketing plus CRM, gamification, badge printing, analytics, marketing. Organizers who switch usually say they were tired of stitching together five tools for one event.

Q: How are we different from Whova?
A: Whova does networking and agenda well. We do all of that plus donation management, auctions, gamification with leaderboards, and a rewards marketplace. Broader feature set for organizers who need more than just networking.

Q: How are we different from Bizzabo?
A: Bizzabo prices itself for enterprise. We work with every size — a 200-person workshop or a 50,000-person expo. We also have fundraising tools and auto-generated event sites that Bizzabo doesn't.

Q: How are we different from Hopin?
A: Hopin is built for virtual. We do in-person, virtual, and hybrid — plus real on-ground capabilities like badge printing and QR check-in that Hopin simply doesn't have.

Q: How are we different from On24?
A: On24 is a webinar platform. We cover a much broader range — expos, galas, conferences, trade shows — with deeper engagement tools across all of them.

Q: What's our strongest competitive edge?
A: Three things: genuinely all-in-one with 150+ features so organizers stop juggling tools, competitive pricing, and on-ground capabilities most platforms skip entirely.

Q: Is it cloud-based?
A: Fully. Nothing to install, just log in from any browser.

Q: Multiple events at once?
A: All managed from one dashboard.

Q: White-labeling?
A: Complete white-label — websites, emails, custom domains. Their attendees see their brand.

Q: Built-in CRM?
A: Yes — contacts auto-populate from registration, lead classification, multi-channel outreach, full engagement tracking tied to event history.

Q: How does check-in work?
A: QR scan, badge prints on demand, walk-ins handled. Fast, smooth, no lines.

Q: Mobile app?
A: Personalized schedules, push notifications, networking, live sessions. Everything on their phone.

Q: Event website customization?
A: No-code drag-and-drop builder. Branded, mobile-responsive, white-label with custom domains.

Q: Zoom integration?
A: Native integration. Create or link Zoom meetings right inside the platform.

Q: Other integrations?
A: 5,000+ apps through Zapier. Custom API for enterprise teams.

Q: Marketing tools?
A: Email campaigns, SMS, WhatsApp, push notifications, automated reminders. All from one dashboard.

Q: What support do we offer?
A: 24/7 — chat, email, help center. Clients consistently say the support is one of the best things about working with us.

Q: How do they get started?
A: Book a demo. The team walks through everything tailored to their specific event.

Q: Who's it best for?
A: Any organizer running events of any size — corporate planners, expo organizers, nonprofits, trade shows, conferences, B2B marketing teams.
